# Slim Framework 4 Skeleton Application

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 4 application. This application uses the latest Slim 4 with the [Adapter\TemplateEngine](https://github.com/pllano/template-engine) template renderer. It also uses the Monolog logger.

This skeleton application was built for [AutoRequire](https://github.com/pllano/auto-require). This makes setting up a new Slim Framework application quick and easy.

## Install the Application

Copy the files to the directory where you want to install the new Slim Framework application. Run the index.php

That's it! Now go build something cool.
